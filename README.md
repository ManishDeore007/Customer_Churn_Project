# Customer_Churn_Project
The goal of this project is to identify the key factors that contribute to customer churn and develop a predictive model to forecast customer churn. The project aims to help businesses reduce customer churn by identifying high-risk customers and implementing targeted retention strategies.

**Steps Followed**
1. Data Collection: Collected customer data, including demographic information, transaction history, and customer interaction data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand customer behavior, identify patterns, and correlations.
4. Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features from the data, such as customer tenure, usage patterns, and payment history.
5. Model Development: Developed and trained machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict customer churn.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. Model Deployment: Deployed the best-performing model in a production-ready environment.
8. Insight Generation: Generated insights on the key factors contributing to customer churn and recommended targeted retention strategies.

**Tools and Techniques used**
1. Machine learning algorithms: Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests.
2. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
3. Feature engineering: Extracting relevant features from the data.
4. Model evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Benefits**
1. Reduced customer churn: By identifying high-risk customers, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn.
2. Improved customer satisfaction: By understanding customer behavior and preferences, businesses can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
3. Increased revenue: By reducing customer churn, businesses can increase revenue and improve profitability.

**Challenges**
1. Data quality: Ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data.
2. Model interpretability: Interpreting the results of the machine learning models.
3. Model deployment: Deploying the model in a production-ready environment.
